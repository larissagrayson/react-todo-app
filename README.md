**AUTHOR:**  Larissa Grayson  
**DATE:**  February 11, 2021


**DESCRIPTION:** This app was built as part of the "React Tutorial From Scratch" created by [Ibas Majid](https://ibaslogic.com/react-tutorial-for-beginners/). The app allows the user to add new to-dos and edit or delete existing ones.  It saves the state to Local Storage and utilizes React Router to navigate to different pages.

A live demo of this app can be viewed [here](https://larissagrayson.github.io/react-todo-app/).
